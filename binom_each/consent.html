    <p><b>Title of Research Study:</b> Syntactic Prediction in Online Sentence Processing</p>
    <p><b>IRB Study Number:</b> STU00212804</p>
    <p><b>Investigator:</b> Masaya Yoshida</p>
    <p><b>Supported By:</b> This research is supported by the Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University.</p>
    
    <p><b>Key Information about this Study:</b></p>
    
    <p>The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is explained later on in this form.</p>
    <ul>
       <li>The purpose of this study is to uncover the mechanism of syntactic prediction during online sentence processing.</li>
       <li>You will be asked to read sentences on a computer screen (either whole sentences, or word by word) and answer questions about them. For some sentences, you may be asked to say how &quot;natural&quot; you find the sentence.</li>
       <li>We expect that you will be in this research study for about 30 minutes, no more than 1 hour.</li>
       <li>There are no risks associated with participation besides standard risks from using a computer (headache, boredom, sore eyes).</li>
       <li>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from participating in this research.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Why am I being asked to take part in this study?</b></p>
       <p>We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are a speaker of English and over 18 years of age.</p>
    
    <p><b>How many people will be in this study?</b></p>
       <p>We expect about 1000 people will be in this research study.</p>
    
    <p><b>What should I know about participating in a research study?</b></p>
    <ul>
       <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
       <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
       <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
       <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>What happens if I say &quot;Yes, I want to be in this research&quot;?</b></p>
       <p>If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will be presented with written instructions for this experiment. You can ask any questions you might have to the research team at m-yoshida@northwestern.edu</li>
      <li>As a participant in this experiment, you will be asked to complete one or more of the two following tasks:</li>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Acceptability Judgment Task</b>: You will be presented with sets of sentences or dialogues and be required to answer questions about the extent to which those sentences or dialogues sound acceptable.</li>
        <li><b>Computer-based Reading</b>: You will see a series of English sentences or words on-screen, and will press keys to advance the sentences, and sometimes answer questions about the sentences.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The experiment will last about 30 minutes, no more than 1 hour</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Will being in this study help me in any way?</b></p>
       <p>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research.</p>   
    
    <p><b>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</b></p>
        <p>There are no risks associated with this study aside from standard computer-use risks (headache, boredom, sore eyes).</p>
    
    <p><b>What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my mind later?</b></p>
       <p>Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate. If you do not want to be in this study or withdraw from the study at any point, your decision will not affect your relationship with Northwestern University.</p>
       <p>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. Withdrawing from the study early or not completing the study will result in no payment being given.</p>
       <p>If you decide to leave the research, please close the browser window. If this happens, all data collected before withdrawal from the study will not be used. If you want to withdraw your data, please contact the investigator at m-yoshida@northwestern.edu.</p>
       
    <p><b>How will the researchers protect my information?</b></p>
       <p>Data will be uploaded to a password protected computer, under an anonymous identification number for each participant, that can be only accessed by logging into a password protected account. Participants&apos; information is anonymous and will never be associated with their name or other identifiable markers, including by researchers who may have access to their data.</p> 
       
    <p><b>Who will have access to the information collected during this research study?</b></p>
       <p>Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy.</p>
       <p>There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or after this study. Examples include:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may need access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.</li>
         <li>The research team may give information to appropriate authorities for reasons of health and safety &ndash; for example, if you indicate that you plan to harm yourself or others, or for public health reasons.</li>
       </ul>
       
    <p><b>How might the information collected in this study be shared in the future?</b></p>
       <p>We will keep the information we collect about you during this research study for 7 years after completion of the study for record keeping. However, we are not collecting any identifiers through the online survey and the responses cannot be traced back to any individual.</p> 
       <p>De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community, with journals in which study results are published, and with databases and data repositories used for research.</p> 
       <p>The results of this study could be shared in articles and presentations.</p>
       
    <p><b>Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?</b></p>
       <p>You will receive $6 for your participation in this study. Withdrawing from the study early or not completing the study will result in no payment being given, unless this is a direct result of technological failures on our part.</p>
    
    <p><b>Who can I talk to?</b></p>
